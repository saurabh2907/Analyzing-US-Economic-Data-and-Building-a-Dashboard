# Analyzing-US-Economic-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard
In this project, as a data scientist working at a real estate investment trust. The trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I am tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I have analyzed and predicted housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors and so on.

## Data science Displayed on a Dashboard

Extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it is a necessary part of data science;
therefore individuals can make correct decisions based on the data.
In this project, I will extract some essential economic indicators from some data,
I will then display these economic indicators in a Dashboard.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators.
Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced.
Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying authentic data in dashboards.
Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this project
